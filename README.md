# SeleniumHeadlessTest
Solution for running Selenium based UI tests on linux headless

This contains two examples of  HtmlUnitDriver() and of PhantomJSDriver();
Both aproaches use headless execution.
Note:The PhantomJSDriver implementation requires that the PhantomJS headless web browser be installed and the path to the
phantomjs.exe set in the code. the packaged version has a windows version but linux versions are available at http://phantomjs.org/ .
